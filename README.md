I'm a professor emeritus at UC Berkeley.

A few years before my retirement I created a new course, *Electronics for IoT*, with the goal of exposing students (and others) to using microcontrollers.

Like many things, not all of my ideas were quite realized. This is my second attempt to completing (ups, no, continuing) what I started.
