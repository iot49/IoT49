MQTT throughput, broker iot.eclipse.org:   2.3730 msg/s (N=100)
MQTT throughput, broker dev.home:         11.3020 msg/s (N=100)

Messenger throughput:                      3.9661 msg/s (N=100)


Conclusion:
With a close broker, MQTT is much more than 2x faster than Messenger
--> no point to bother with messenger
--> setup good mqtt broker, close to home!
